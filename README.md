# Blog Project
### Intentions
My intent with this project is to provide an opportunity where I can learn Next.js and show my skills with web-development and JavaScript. That being said, this project is in no way meant to look aesthetically beautiful, but to be very full-featured and thought out. I may later come back with styling and other things, but for now It'll be pretty bare-bones.
